Certainly! Here's how you can integrate the descriptive text into the Streamlit app along with the code you provided. This code will now include the narrative explanations of the offensive and defensive ratings directly in the Streamlit interface.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

def load_data():
    # Load the data from a CSV file
    csv_file_path = '2023-2024 NBA Player Stats_exported.csv'
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    # Calculate ratings
    df['Offensive_Rating'] = df['PTS']  # Assume PTS is the offensive rating
    df['Defensive_Rating'] = df['STL'] + df['BLK']  # Sum of steals and blocks as the defensive rating
    return df

def calculate_team_ratings(df):
    # Group by team and calculate mean ratings
    return df.groupby('Tm').agg({
        'Offensive_Rating': 'mean', 
        'Defensive_Rating': 'mean'
    }).reset_index()

def plot_ratings(data, selected_teams, rating_type):
    # Filter data for selected teams
    filtered_data = data[data['Tm'].isin(selected_teams)]
    # Plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    team_indices = range(len(filtered_data))  # Team indices
    color = 'blue' if rating_type == 'Defensive_Rating' else 'red'
    ax.bar(team_indices, filtered_data[rating_type], color=color, label=rating_type)

    ax.set_xlabel('Teams')
    ax.set_ylabel('Rating')
    ax.set_title(f'Team {rating_type}')
    ax.set_xticks(team_indices)
    ax.set_xticklabels(filtered_data['Tm'])
    ax.legend()

    st.pyplot(fig)

def main():
    st.title("NBA Team Ratings Visualization")
    st.write("""
    NBA Team Ratings Visualization app. This tool allows you to compare the offensive and defensive ratings of NBA teams for the 2023-2024 season.
    """)
    
    st.markdown("""
    ### Ratings Explanation
    - **Offensive Rating**: This rating is calculated based on the total points scored (PTS) by the players. A higher offensive rating indicates a better offensive performance.
    - **Defensive Rating**: This rating is the sum of steals (STL) and blocks (BLK) by the players, representing the team's defensive capabilities. Higher values suggest stronger defense.
    """)
    
    df = load_data()
    team_ratings = calculate_team_ratings(df)

    # Dropdown to select teams
    teams = team_ratings['Tm'].unique().tolist()
    selected_teams = st.multiselect('Select teams to compare:', teams, default=[])

    # Dropdown to select rating type
    rating_types = ['Offensive_Rating', 'Defensive_Rating']
    selected_rating_type = st.selectbox('Select rating type:', rating_types)

    if selected_teams:
        plot_ratings(team_ratings, selected_teams, selected_rating_type)
    else:
        st.write("Select one or more teams to display ratings.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated version of your code now includes the necessary context and explanations for users to understand what the ratings mean and how they are calculated. It also features the revised color coding for the bar graphs based on the selected rating type. This should make your app more informative and visually intuitive.
